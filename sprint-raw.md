### **WebSocket**
- **What it is**: WebSocket is a protocol that enables two-way communication between client and server over a single, long-lived connection.
- **What it does**: It allows real-time, bidirectional communication between a web browser and a server, useful for applications like chat or live updates.
- **Linked with**: Real-time web applications, Spring WebSocket, WebSockets in browsers.

### **AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)**
- **What it is**: AOP is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by separating cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security, transactions).
- **What it does**: It allows you to define "aspects" that can be applied to specific parts of the application without modifying the core logic.
- **Linked with**: Spring AOP, AspectJ.

### **Aspect**
- **What it is**: An aspect is a modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes, such as logging, security, or transaction management.
- **What it does**: It encapsulates a cross-cutting concern into a reusable module and applies it to various parts of an application.
- **Linked with**: AOP, AspectJ, Spring AOP.

### **Instrumentation**
- **What it is**: Instrumentation refers to the ability to monitor or modify the behavior of a program at runtime.
- **What it does**: It allows you to add hooks into a program to collect performance data, modify bytecode, or implement custom behavior.
- **Linked with**: JVM (Java Virtual Machine), bytecode manipulation, Spring's monitoring.

### **Messaging**
- **What it is**: Messaging refers to the exchange of data between systems or components in a decoupled manner.
- **What it does**: It supports communication between different parts of a system or between different systems using message queues or topics.
- **Linked with**: JMS (Java Message Service), ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ, Spring Integration.

### **SpEL (Spring Expression Language)**
- **What it is**: SpEL is a powerful expression language used within the Spring framework to query and manipulate objects at runtime.
- **What it does**: It allows you to inject dynamic values or logic into Spring beans or configuration, enabling flexible and conditional behavior in Spring applications.
- **Linked with**: Spring Beans, Spring Security, Spring EL.

### **JMS (Java Message Service)**
- **What it is**: JMS is a Java API that provides messaging capabilities for Java applications, enabling communication between different components using queues or topics.
- **What it does**: It supports asynchronous messaging for decoupled communication between distributed components in a Java application.
- **Linked with**: Messaging systems (e.g., ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ), Spring JMS.

### **OXM (Object/XML Mapping)**
- **What it is**: OXM is a technique for converting Java objects to XML and vice versa.
- **What it does**: It enables Java applications to read from and write to XML documents, mapping the XML data structure to Java objects.
- **Linked with**: JAXB (Java Architecture for XML Binding), Spring OXM.

---

### **Portlet**
- **What it is**: A portlet is a web component that handles requests and generates dynamic content, typically in the context of a portal (a web-based interface aggregating multiple services).
- **What it does**: It processes requests from portal users and generates content, such as HTML, to be displayed in a portal page.
- **Linked with**: Java Portlet API, Liferay, Spring Portlet.
